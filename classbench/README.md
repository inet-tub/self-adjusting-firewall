# Few changes

1. Classbench trace generator does not allow `a` and `b`, the pareto distribution parameters to be greater than 1. We removed this restriction enabling full use of the pareto distribution in the trace generator.
2. Few simple corrections in the db_generator and trace generator to resolve compilation errors.
